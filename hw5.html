      The mousedown and mouseup events are used, respectively, to show and hide a picture then display it under the mouse cursor whenever the mouse button is clicked, regardless of where the cursor is at the time. The offsets (-190 for left and -350 for top) modify the actual cursor position so that the message is approximately centered over it.
